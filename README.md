# Text Similarity Techniques Tutorial

## Overview
This tutorial explores text similarity techniques in Natural Language Processing, focusing on:
- Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
-  Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)
-  Cosine Similarity for text comparison

## Contents
1. PDF Tutorial on TF-IDF vs BERT
2. Jupyter Notebook with AI assistant implementations
3. Jupiter Notebook for plot

## Learning Objectives
- Understand TF-IDF and BERT text representation methods
- Learn cosine similarity for measuring text proximity
- Explore how to build basic AI assistants
- Compare different text similarity approaches

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook
4. Run and explore the implementations

## Prerequisites
